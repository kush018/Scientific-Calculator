# Scientific-Calculator
 A scientific calculator written in Java

## Running the calculator program

In order to run the program for yourself, just go to the "Releases" section and download the installer executable file, then run it and install the application on your computer.

However, this will only work for windows users. If you are not a windows user, you will have to compile the code yourself. To learn how to compile the code by yourself, see [COMPILE.md](COMPILE.md). It also contains information on how to create the windows installer executable on your own.
